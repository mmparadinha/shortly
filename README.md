# Shortly

Shortly is link shortener


## About it

When you want to share an url and it is too big it may look weird and suspicious, so why not shorten it to a more familiar look?

With Shortly you can create your account and shorten links for free, keep record of your links and how many access they got!<br>
By tracking the access numbers to each shortened link, it gives you data: do your clients rather click on a big green button or on a big red cross? Make two shortened links for the same url and compare!<br>
It also features a ranking system, allowing you to compare your reach to other users!

### Try it:
  - Create your account
  - Choose an url
  - ***SHORTLY***
  - Share your newly created mini-link
  - Let the games begin - observe your metrics!
